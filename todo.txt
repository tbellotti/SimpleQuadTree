1. Check const and stuff like that for all the classes
- point.h [DONE]
- cell.h [DONE]
- quadtree.h [DONE, but check it for functions once all the rest is clear]
- lipschitzfunction.h [DONE]
- refinementcriterion.h [DONE, but look again if we change something]

2. Think at the way of deal with callable objects and their inheritance (look at the main in order to 
understand what we want to obtain and try to define as less classes as possible).

3. Try to factorize the recursive visit

4. Check the parallel algorithm and find a machine to test it properly

5. Write a main file to test almost every feature of the code.
- point.h [DONE]
- cell.h [DONE]

6. Produce a scheme of the classes and their relationships
- point.h [DONE]
- cell.h [DONE]
