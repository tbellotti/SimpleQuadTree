Thing to remind to tell during the discussion:
- The recursive way is for sure not the most efficient way to deal with large quadtree and to find neighbors etc, but it is for sure the most natural and easiest one to implement for a first implementation. Anyway one can think about changing the implementation without touching the interface... or almost.


1. Check const and stuff like that for all the classes
- point.h [DONE]
- cell.h [DONE]
- quadtree.h [DONE, but check it for functions once all the rest is clear]
- lipschitzfunction.h [DONE]
- refinementcriterion.h [DONE]
- levelsetcriterion.h [DONE]

2. Think at the way of deal with callable objects and their inheritance (look at the main in order to 
understand what we want to obtain and try to define as less classes as possible).
SEEMS OK

I have started to do this but it should be done in a more proper way and thinking about
the question of having const pointer and references and stuff like that.

3. Try to factorize the recursive visit and CLEAN the quadtree.h class!
I got to the conclusion that we cannot or is too difficult and complicates the code
more than the advantage of factorizing something if any.


4. Check the parallel algorithm and find a machine to test it properly

5. Write a main file to test almost every feature of the code.
- point.h [DONE]
- cell.h [DONE]
- lipschitzfunction.h [DONE]
- refinementcriterion.h [DONE]
- quadtree.h [SEEMS DONE BUT THINK ABOUT IT]

6. Produce a scheme of the classes and their relationships
- point.h [DONE]
- cell.h [DONE]
- refinementcriterion.h [DONE]
- levelsetcriterion.h [DONE]

7. Reorganize the project into FOLDER at the very end...
DONE.

8. Control the presence of destructors and similar for each class.
